  - **Random Send**: Send tokens to randomly generated addresses.
  - **Send and Receive**: Send tokens to new accounts and retrieve them back to the original wallet.
- **Balance Checks**: Display wallet balances for XRP and supported ERC-20 tokens.
- **Optimized Gas Usage**: Configurable gas limits and dynamic gas pricing with a 20% premium for faster confirmations.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Handles RPC timeouts with configurable retries for robust execution.
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface powered by `inquirer` for action selection and configuration.
- **Colorized Output**: Enhanced console output using `chalk` for better readability.
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Execute actions across multiple wallets loaded from environment variables.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher.
- **npm**: Node package manager for installing dependencies.
- **XPRL Testnet RPC**: A valid RPC URL (default: `https://rpc.testnet.xrplevm.org/`).
- **Private Keys**: Wallet private keys stored in a `.env` file (format: `PRIVATE_KEY_1`, `PRIVATE_KEY_2`, etc.).
- **Testnet Tokens**: Sufficient XRP and ERC-20 tokens (RIBBIT, RISE, WXRP) for testing.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository (optional).

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kazuha787/Xprl-Auto-Bot.git
   cd Xprl-Auto-Bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your private keys and optional RPC URL:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY_1=0xyour_private_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

---

## File Structure

The project follows a clean and modular structure:

```
xprl-testnet-bot/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js              # Main script with bot logic
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                  # Environment variables (private keys, RPC URL)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Project metadata and dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json     # Dependency lock file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation (this file)
â””â”€â”€ node_modules/         # Installed dependencies
```

- **`index.js`**: Core script containing the bot's logic, including wallet management, swaps, liquidity addition, and token transfers.
- **`.env`**: Stores sensitive information like private keys and RPC URL. **Never commit this file to version control.**
- **`package.json`**: Defines the project, scripts, and dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and contribution.

---

## Usage

1. **Start the Bot**:
   Run the script to initialize the bot and test the RPC connection:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Interact with the CLI**:
   - The bot displays a colorful ASCII banner and tests the RPC connection.
   - Choose an action from the interactive menu:
     - **Perform Swaps**: Execute token swaps across defined trading pairs.
     - **Add Liquidity**: Add liquidity to token pairs (e.g., XRP/WXRP).
     - **Send Tokens**: Perform random or send-and-receive token transfers.
     - **Check Balances**: View wallet balances for XRP and ERC-20 tokens.
     - **Exit**: Terminate the bot.

3. **Configure Actions**:
   - For swaps: Specify the number of swaps per wallet and the amount per swap.
   - For liquidity: Input the XRP and token amounts for the liquidity pool.
   - For token transfers: Choose the send type (random or send-and-receive), number of transfers, and amount per transfer.

4. **Monitor Output**:
   - Transactions are logged with links to the XPRL testnet explorer.
   - Success and error messages are color-coded for clarity.

---

## Configuration

The bot is pre-configured with the following settings, which can be modified in `index.js`:

- **Token Addresses**:
  ```javascript
  const TOKENS = {
    XRP: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
    RIBBIT: "0x73ee7BC68d3f07CfcD68776512b7317FE57E1939",
    RISE: "0x0c28777DEebe4589e83EF2Dc7833354e6a0aFF85",
    WXRP: "0x81Be083099c2C65b062378E74Fa8469644347BB7",
  };
  ```

- **Trading Pairs**:
  ```javascript
  const ALL_PAIRS = [
    ["XRP", "RIBBIT"],
    ["XRP", "RISE"],
    ["XRP", "WXRP"],
    ["RIBBIT", "RISE"],
    ["RISE", "WXRP"],
    ["WXRP", "RIBBIT"],
  ];
  ```

- **Gas Settings**:
  - `GAS_LIMIT_ERC20`: 65,000 (for ERC-20 transfers).
  - `GAS_LIMIT_XRP`: 21,000 (for XRP/ETH transfers).
  - `GAS_LIMIT_COMPLEX`: 200,000 (for swaps and liquidity).
  - Gas price: Dynamic with a 20% premium for faster confirmations.

- **Delays**:
  - `DELAY_BETWEEN_SWAPS`: 200ms.
  - `DELAY_BETWEEN_WALLETS`: 500ms.

- **Router Address**:
  ```javascript
  const ROUTER_ADDRESS = "0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D";
  ```

- **Explorer URL**:
  ```javascript
  const EXPLORER_TX_URL = "https://explorer.testnet.xrplevm.org/tx/";
  ```

---

## Available Actions

1. **Perform Swaps**:
   - Executes token swaps on a Uniswap-like router.
   - Supports XRP and ERC-20 token pairs (e.g., XRP/RIBBIT, RIBBIT/RISE).
   - Randomly selects trading pairs and direction (A-to-B or B-to-A).

2. **Add Liquidity**:
   - Adds liquidity to a token pair (e.g., XRP/WXRP).
   - Requires approval of ERC-20 tokens and XRP for the router contract.

3. **Send Tokens**:
   - **Random Send**: Transfers tokens to randomly generated addresses.
   - **Send and Receive**: Sends tokens to new accounts, funds them with XRP for gas, and retrieves tokens back.

4. **Check Balances**:
   - Displays balances for XRP and supported ERC-20 tokens for all wallets.

## Dependencies

The bot relies on the following npm packages:

| Package       | Version | Description                              |
|---------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| `ethers`      | ^6.0.0  | Ethereum library for wallet and contract interactions |
| `chalk`       | ^4.1.2  | Colorized console output                 |
| `inquirer`    | ^8.2.4  | Interactive CLI prompts                  |
| `dotenv`      | ^16.0.0 | Environment variable management          |

Install them using:
```bash
npm install ethers chalk inquirer dotenv
```

---

## Error Handling

- **RPC Timeouts**: The bot retries failed RPC calls up to 3 times with a 200ms delay.
- **Insufficient Funds**: Checks wallet balances before transfers to prevent failures.
- **Transaction Failures**: Logs detailed error messages with transaction hashes for debugging.
- **Invalid Inputs**: Validates user inputs (e.g., swap count, amounts) to ensure proper execution.
